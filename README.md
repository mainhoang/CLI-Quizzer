# CLI-Quizzer
This is a back-end app. I created 2 files; each creates a different type of CLI quiz. I use Node.js & NPM package Inquirer to make a flashcard generator. The generator lets you decide how many flashcards to create, as well the Q & A. Run node basicCards.js to create basic flashcard functioning quiz. Run node clozeCards.js to create a fill-in-the-blanks type quiz.
